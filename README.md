# Book_Inventory

A book shop maintains the inventory of books that are being sold at the shop. The list includes details such as author,title,price, publisher and stock position.

- Whenever a customer wants book, the sales person inputs the title and author and the system searches the list and displays whether it is available or not.

- IF it is not, an appropriate messages is displayed. If it is, then the system displays the book details and requests for the number of copies required.

-If the requested copies are available, the total cost of the required copies is displayed; otherwise the message "Required copies not in stock" is displayed.

Design a system using a class called books with suitable member functions and Constructors. Allocate memory dynamically in constructor to allocate memory space required.
